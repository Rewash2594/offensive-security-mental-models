# Reconnaissance Mental Model

## Purpose

Reconnaissance is not about collecting as much data as possible.
It is about **reducing uncertainty** before committing to action.

The goal is to answer:
- What kind of system am I dealing with?
- Where is human error most likely?
- What assumptions can I safely make?

---

## Core Principle

> Every action taken without understanding increases noise and risk.

Good reconnaissance minimizes:
- unnecessary interaction
- detection surface
- wasted effort

---

## The Three Reconnaissance Questions

Before touching any tool, answer these:

1. **What am I observing?**
   - Technology stack indicators
   - Organizational patterns
   - User behavior signals

2. **What does this system likely value?**
   - Availability
   - Confidentiality
   - Convenience
   - Speed

3. **Where does complexity concentrate?**
   - Authentication flows
   - Integrations
   - Legacy components
   - Manual processes

---

## Passive vs Active Thinking

Passive reconnaissance is not only about OSINT.
It is about **forming hypotheses without interaction**.

Active reconnaissance should only occur when:
- a hypothesis exists
- the cost of interaction is justified
- the expected signal outweighs the noise

---

## Hypothesis-Driven Reconnaissance

Reconnaissance without hypotheses is data hoarding.

A proper flow is:

1. Observation
2. Hypothesis
3. Minimal validation
4. Adjustment or discard

If a hypothesis cannot be articulated, reconnaissance is premature.

---

## Common Failure Modes

- Tool-first thinking
- Scanning without purpose
- Collecting data with no decision impact
- Confusing visibility with understanding

---

## Output of Good Reconnaissance

Successful reconnaissance produces:
- prioritized attack surfaces
- discarded paths
- justified next steps

If everything looks equally interesting, reconnaissance failed.

---

## Final Note

Reconnaissance is a thinking discipline.
Tools are optional. Reasoning is not.
