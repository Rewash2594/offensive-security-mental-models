# Exploitation Decision Tree

## Purpose

Exploitation is not about firing payloads.
It is about **making irreversible decisions with incomplete information**.

The goal is not exploitation itself.
The goal is **control with minimal exposure**.

---

## Core Principle

> Every exploit attempt commits you to a branch you may not be able to undo.

Good exploitation minimizes:
- assumptions
- retries
- visibility

---

## Before Exploitation: Mandatory Questions

Before attempting exploitation, answer:

1. **What breaks if this fails?**
   - Access
   - Stability
   - Stealth

2. **What signal will this generate?**
   - Logs
   - Alerts
   - Human attention

3. **Is there a quieter branch?**
   - Configuration abuse
   - Logic flaws
   - Trust relationships

## Decision Tree Thinking

Exploitation decisions should follow branches, not impulses:

- If reliability is low → delay execution
- If impact is high → reduce surface
- If detection risk is unknown → gather more signal

Blind exploitation collapses optionality.

---

## Exploit Selection Criteria

An exploit is acceptable only if:
- success conditions are understood
- failure modes are predictable
- rollback is possible or unnecessary

If rollback is impossible, exploitation must be decisive.

---

## Common Failure Modes

- Payload-first thinking
- Overconfidence in exploit reliability
- Ignoring environmental variance
- Repeating failed attempts

---

## Output of Good Exploitation Decisions

Proper exploitation produces:
- controlled execution
- stable access
- minimal artifacts

If exploitation causes chaos, the decision failed.

---

## Final Note

Exploitation is not a technical action.
It is a strategic commitment.
